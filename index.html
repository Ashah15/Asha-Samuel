        <li><strong>1958. </strong> - was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago</li>
        <li>
        <strong>1989</strong> - Jackson used sexual imagery and choreography, and touched his chest, torso and crotch. When asked by Winfrey in the 1993 interview about why he grabbed his crotch, he said it was spontaneously compelled by the music. Time magazine described the "Bad" video as "infamous". It featured Wesley Snipes; Jackson's later videos often featured famous cameo roles.[340][341] For the "Smooth Criminal" video, Jackson experimented with leaning forward at a 45 degree angle, beyond the performer's center of gravity. To accomplish this live, Jackson and designers developed a special shoe to lock the performer's feet to the stage, allowing them to lean forward. They were granted U.S. Patent 5,255,452 for the device.

        <strong>1993</strong> - was accused of child sexual abuse by a 13-year-old boy, Jordan Chandler, and his father, Evan Chandler.[160] Jordan said he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex.[358] Jordan's mother said that there had been no wrongdoing on Jackson's part.[359] Evan was recorded discussing his intention to pursue charges, which Jackson used to argue that he was the victim of a jealous father trying to extort money.[359] Jackson's older sister La Toya accused him of being a pedophile, which she later retracted

        <li>
        <strong>2013</strong> - choreographer Wade Robson filed a lawsuit alleging that Jackson had sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was seven years old.[374] In 2014, a case was filed by James Safechuck, alleging sexual abuse over a four-year period from the age of ten.[375][376][268] Both had testified in Jackson's defense during the 1993 allegations, Robson did so again in 2005.[377][378] In 2015, Robson's case against Jackson's estate was dismissed on the grounds of being filed too late. In 2017, it was ruled that the corporations formerly owned by Jackson could not be held accountable for Jackson's alleged past actions.[379][380] Neither ruling commented on the credibility of the allegations.[269] Safechuck's claim was also time barred

        are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
        plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
        people were selecting the best breeds."
